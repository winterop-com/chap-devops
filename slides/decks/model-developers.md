# Developing a model with chap-devops

## Build it, run it, test it, evaluate it, with Chap around it

For people who write forecasting models

---

## The loop of a model developer

1. **Build** the model as a service, with chapkit.
2. **Run** it: from its checkout, from an image you built, or from GitHub.
3. **Test** that it trains and forecasts at all.
4. **Evaluate** it with a backtest, on sample data and on real data.
5. **Compare** it with the models that exist.
6. **Publish** it, and add it to the marketplace.

chap-devops does each step with one command, and puts chap-core around the model
only when the step needs it.

---

## Two kinds of model

| | chapkit model | MLproject model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What it is | a service: a container with an HTTP API | a directory with an `MLproject` file |
| How chap uses it | over HTTP | it runs the `train` and `predict` commands |
| Environment | the image | `uv_env`, `renv_env` or `docker_env` |
| In a deployment | yes, as a service | yes, with `chap-devops chapkit mlproject run` |
| With `chap-devops chap eval` | by id or URL | by GitHub URL or directory, or with `--run-config.as-chapkit` |

The marketplace and the Modeling App use **chapkit models**. This deck is
about them. The **MLproject models** deck is about the other kind.

---

## A model in the MLproject format

```sh
chap-devops chapkit mlproject run my-model       # serve it, with no build
chap-devops chapkit mlproject migrate my-model   # make it a chapkit service
```

- `mlproject run` serves the directory as a chapkit service. In a
  deployment, it registers with chap-core.
- `mlproject migrate` writes the `Dockerfile` and `main.py` of a chapkit
  service.
- See the deck **MLproject models with chap-devops**.

---

## A chapkit model service

One container that listens on port 8000:

| Route | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /health` | says that the service runs |
| `GET /api/v1/info` | the model: id, name, period type, covariates |
| `/api/v1/configs` | the model configurations |
| `/api/v1/artifacts` | the trained models and the predictions |
| `POST /api/v1/ml/$train` | trains a model from a config and data |
| `POST /api/v1/ml/$predict` | forecasts with a trained model |
| `POST /api/v1/ml/$validate` | checks a request before it runs |
| `GET /api/v1/ml/$generate-sample-data` | data in the shape the model declares |

---

## Start a new model

```sh
chap-devops models new my-model
chap-devops models new my-r-model --template shell-r
```

| Template | What it gives you |
| --- | --- |
| `fn-py` | chapkit service, Python, the model in `main.py` (the default) |
| `shell-py`, `shell-r` | chapkit service, `train` and `predict` scripts in `scripts/` |
| `shell-r-tidyverse`, `shell-r-inla` | the same, with tidyverse and fable, or INLA |
| `mlproject-py`, `mlproject-r`, ... | an `MLproject` file and scripts, no chapkit code |

Docker builds it, so Python is not necessary. `mlproject-py` builds `FROM
chapkit-py-data-cli`. The author comes from git `user.name` and `user.email`.

---

## Registration with chap-core

A model service registers **itself** with chap-core when it starts:

| Variable | What it says |
| --- | --- |
| `SERVICEKIT_ORCHESTRATOR_URL` | where to register: chap-core's `/v2/services/$register` |
| `SERVICEKIT_HOST` | the host chap-core calls the model back at |
| `SERVICEKIT_PORT` | the port chap-core calls the model back at |
| `SERVICEKIT_REGISTRATION_KEY` | the shared secret, when chap-core asks for one |

- In a deployment, chap-devops sets these for you.
- Registration is a heartbeat: `chap-devops status` shows `LAST PING`.
- The service id must be the id the service registers with
  (`MLServiceInfo.id`).

---

## Run a model: four sources

```sh
chap-devops run chapkit_simple_multistep_model                   # a marketplace id
chap-devops run https://github.com/chap-models/chapkit_ghr_model # a GitHub repository
chap-devops run ghcr.io/my-org/my_model:sha-1eb8cf1              # a published image
chap-devops run my-model:dev                                     # an image built here
```

```text
running chapkit_simple_multistep_model on http://localhost:5001 (answered in 4s)
```

- No deployment directory: the model runs in a `chap-devops run` group.
- `chap-devops run -a` shows the model's log. Ctrl-C stops the model.
- `chap-devops ps` lists the models, `chap-devops stop ID` stops one.
- The first run of a model downloads its image: 1 GB for a Python model, 6 to
  7 GB for an R model.

---

## Your model from its checkout

chap-devops runs chap-core. You run the model with `uv run`, a debugger or hot
reload:

```sh
chap-devops init mychap --models none && cd mychap && chap-devops up
```

```sh
export SERVICEKIT_ORCHESTRATOR_URL='http://localhost:8700/v2/services/$register'
export SERVICEKIT_HOST=host.docker.internal
export SERVICEKIT_PORT=8001
uv run uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```

**It worked when** `chap-devops status` lists the model with a recent LAST PING. Its
state is `unmanaged`, because the deployment did not start it.

---

## Why these values

- **`localhost:8700`**: the model runs on your machine, so `localhost` and
  chap-core's API port reach chap-core.
- **`host.docker.internal`**: chap-core runs in a container, where `localhost`
  is the container. This name is your machine. chap-devops maps it on Linux too.
- **`--host 0.0.0.0`**: a call from a container does not arrive on the
  loopback.
- **Single quotes** keep the shell from reading `$register` as a variable.
- With a registration key: export `SERVICEKIT_REGISTRATION_KEY` with the value
  that `chap-devops auth show --reveal` prints.

---

## An image you built yourself

```sh
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t my-model:dev .
chap-devops run my-model:dev
```

In a deployment, with chap-core:

```sh
chap-devops models add my-model:dev
chap-devops up
chap-devops models test my_model
```

- A local image is never pulled: the overlay says `pull_policy: never`.
- Build again with the same tag, then `chap-devops restart`, to use the new build.

---

## `chap-devops models add`: from GitHub or ghcr

```sh
chap-devops models add https://github.com/my-org/chapkit_dengue_model
chap-devops models add ghcr.io/my-org/chapkit_dengue_model:sha-1eb8cf1
```

| Source | Pin | `chap-devops update` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a repository URL | the newest published `sha-` build of the default branch | moves the pin |
| an image reference | exactly the tag or digest you named | leaves it alone |

`models add` asks GitHub for the branch and its commits, and ghcr for the
newest commit with a published `sha-<short commit>` build: the tag that the
publish workflow writes.

---

## What `models add` resolves

```text
added chapkit_dengue_model (chapkit-dengue-model)
  source    https://github.com/my-org/chapkit_dengue_model
  image     ghcr.io/my-org/chapkit_dengue_model:sha-b1d6c31
  pin       sha-b1d6c31  (commit b1d6c31)
  follows   main  (`chap-devops update` moves the pin)
  data dir  /work/data  (from the image config)
  user      10001:10001  (from a docker probe)
```

Each line says where its value came from, because no reviewed catalogue
entry gave it.

---

## The flags of `models add`

| Flag | What it sets | Without it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--id` | the model id; `auto` picks a free one. Not `persistence`, `global_median` or `seasonal_median` | the name in snake_case |
| `--service-id` | the compose service and DNS name | the id with hyphens |
| `--name` | the display name | the repository or image name |
| `--port N\|auto`, `--bind` | a host port, and its address | no host port |
| `--data-dir` | the writable data directory | `<WorkingDir>/data` from the image |
| `--user` | the user the container runs as | the image's own user, or a probe |
| `--runtime-amd64` | the image runs on amd64 only | asked from ghcr |

---

## The marketplace entry

A model in the marketplace is a YAML file in the registry. An excerpt of
`models/auto_arima_chapkit.yaml`:

```yaml
id: auto_arima_chapkit
service_id: auto-arima-chapkit
source:
  repository: https://github.com/chap-models/auto_arima_chapkit
  image: ghcr.io/chap-models/auto_arima_chapkit
compatibility:
  period_types: [monthly]
  max_prediction_periods: 12
channels:
  stable: 1.0.2
```

---

## Versions and channels

Each version pins one commit and the image built from it:

```yaml
versions:
  - version: 1.0.2
    commit: e9047d405050869a8918ba55ddca95d271961a00
    image_tag: sha-e9047d4
    chapkit: ">=2.2.0,<3"
    status: verified
```

```sh
chap-devops models enable chapkit_simple_multistep_model                   # stable
chap-devops models enable chapkit_simple_multistep_model --channel latest
chap-devops models enable chapkit_simple_multistep_model --version 0.1.1   # a pin
```

---

## The overlay chap-devops writes for a model

```yaml
chapkit-simple-multistep-model:
  image: ghcr.io/chap-models/chapkit_simple_multistep_model:sha-10b2bc7
  platform: linux/amd64
  expose: ["8000"]
  read_only: true
  security_opt: [no-new-privileges:true]
  cap_drop: [ALL]
  user: 1001:1001
  volumes: [tmpfs on /tmp, ck_chapkit_simple_multistep_model_data on /app/data]
```

The real file has one setting on each line, and `.env` can override the
image tag. This is a short form.

---

## What the overlay checks for you

- **Platform:** marketplace images are amd64 only, so the overlay pins
  `linux/amd64`. On Apple silicon they run under emulation.
- **The user:** chap-devops reads it from the image config, not from a guess. A root
  image gets no `user:` line.
- **Read-only:** a read-only file system, `no-new-privileges`, no
  capabilities, a 2 GB tmpfs on `/tmp`.
- **The data directory** is a named volume, the only writable path apart from
  `/tmp`.

A model that writes outside its data directory fails here first, not in
production.

---

## The init container

Before the model starts, a busybox container chowns the data volume:

```yaml
chapkit-simple-multistep-model-init:
  image: busybox:1.38
  command: ["sh", "-c", "chown -R 1001:1001 /app/data"]
  user: "0:0"
```

- A volume that docker makes belongs to root. The model does not run as root.
- The chown is recursive, so a volume that an older build owned is
  corrected too.
- It runs for every model, a root image too.

---

## Test: does it work at all?

```sh
chap-devops models test my_model             # chapkit test, in the model's own container
chap-devops models test my_model --backtest  # the whole way, through chap-core
chap-devops models test --all                # every model of the deployment
```

- `chap-devops status` can be all green while a model cannot predict at all:
  registration is a heartbeat.
- `chap-devops models test` makes the model do the work.
- Exit code: not zero only when a model **failed**. A model that chap-devops could
  not test is a skip.

---

## The model level

chap-devops runs chapkit's own test in the model's container:

```text
docker compose exec -T <service> chapkit test --url http://127.0.0.1:8000 --timeout 300
```

chapkit reads the config schema, makes a config, generates data for the
declared covariates and period type, then validates, trains and predicts.

- **It proves:** the image runs, the user can write, the runtime has its
  libraries, and the model makes a prediction.
- **It does not touch** chap-core. It answers in seconds.

---

## The backtest level

`--backtest` goes the way the Modeling App goes:

1. Sample data from the model: `$generate-sample-data`, 36 periods, 5 org units.
2. `POST /v1/analytics/make-dataset`, and a wait for the job.
3. `POST /v1/analytics/create-backtest`: 3 periods, 2 splits, stride 1.
4. The scores from the backtest's `aggregateMetrics`.

```text
chapkit-simple-multistep-model    pass      13s   crps 5.4  mae 7.3  rmse 9.0
  configured model: monthly_climate (id 14)
```

The line under the row names the configured model that the backtest used.
Scores on generated data say that the pipeline works, not that the model is
good.

---

## Flags of `chap-devops models test`

| Flag | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `--all` | every model in `.chap-devops/models.yaml` |
| `--backtest` | the backtest level, through chap-core |
| `--config NAME` | the configured model to backtest, by its variant name |
| `--seed N` | the same generated data on each run, so two runs compare |
| `--timeout SECONDS` | 300 at the model level, 900 with `--backtest` |
| `--keep` | keep what the test made, and say how to delete it |
| `-vv` | the whole output of `chapkit test`, and each request |
| `--json` | one object for each model, with all the metrics |

Without `--keep`, chap-devops deletes the configs, artifacts, dataset and backtest
that the test made, and nothing else.

---

## More work for the model level

These flags are for the model level only. `--backtest` refuses them.

| Flag | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `--configs N` | the configs that `chapkit test` makes (1) |
| `--trainings N` | the trainings of each config (1) |
| `--predictions N` | the predictions of each trained model (1) |
| `--rows N` | the rows of the training data (250) |
| `--predict-rows N` | the rows of the data of each prediction (150) |

```sh
chap-devops models test my_model --rows 600 --predict-rows 300
chap-devops models test my_model --configs 2 --trainings 2
```

---

## Evaluate on real data

In a subdirectory of the deployment (`mkdir eval && cd eval`):

```sh
chap-devops chap eval --model-name my_model \
  --dataset-csv laos_subset.csv --output-file mine.nc
```

Or straight from the checkout, with no deployment:

```sh
chap-devops chap eval --model-name ./my_model_checkout \
  --dataset-csv laos_subset.csv --output-file mine_local.nc
```

- A model id of the deployment: chap-devops starts that model, without chap-core.
- A directory with an `MLproject`: chap runs it in the worker image (uv, R,
  INLA). Add `--docker` when the `MLproject` uses `docker_env`.

---

## Compare with the models that exist

```sh
chap-devops chap eval --model-name auto_arima_chapkit \
  --dataset-csv laos_subset.csv --output-file arima.nc
chap-devops chap export-metrics mine.nc arima.nc --output-file comparison.csv
chap-devops chap plot-backtest mine.nc --output-file mine.html
```

- One row for each model: `crps`, `mae`, `rmse`, the interval coverage and
  more.
- A baseline: `--model-name builtin:seasonal_median`. It needs chap-core
  v2.5.0 or later.

---

## Configurations for the marketplace entry

```sh
chap-devops models configs add my_model --name short_lags --set n_lags=2,2
chap-devops models configs export my_model --out configurations.yaml
```

- The file is the `configurations:` block of a marketplace entry. Put it in
  the entry of your model.
- Each configuration has its variant name, a `description` and a `config`.
- In another deployment, this adds all of them:

```sh
chap-devops models configs add my_model --from configurations.yaml
```

---

## The whole loop, after a code change

```sh
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t my-model:dev .   # 1. build again
chap-devops restart                                           # 2. use the new build
chap-devops models test my_model                              # 3. it still predicts
chap-devops models test my_model --backtest --seed 1          # 4. through chap-core
cd eval
chap-devops chap eval --model-name my_model \
  --dataset-csv laos_subset.csv --output-file mine.nc   # 5. on real data
chap-devops chap export-metrics mine.nc arima.nc --output-file comparison.csv
```

`--seed 1` gives the same sample data each time, so the scores of two builds
compare.

---

## When something fails

```sh
chap-devops logs -f my-model          # the model's own log
chap-devops jobs                      # what chap-core ran, newest first
chap-devops jobs logs JOB_ID          # why a backtest failed: the model's stderr
chap-devops api GET /v2/services      # what chap-core registered, as JSON
chap-devops doctor                    # the machine and the deployment
```

- A failed backtest says why in `chap-devops jobs logs` and nowhere else.
- From chap-core v2.5.0, `chap-devops jobs` also shows a `baseline/<model>` job for
  each built-in model of a backtest.
- A model test failure names the phase (`train`, `predict`) and the first line
  of the model's error. Add `-vv` for the whole output.

---

## Start now

```sh
chap-devops models new my-model && cd my-model
git init && git add . && git commit -m "feat: first version"
docker build --platform linux/amd64 --build-arg GIT_REVISION=$(git rev-parse HEAD) -t my-model:dev .
chap-devops run my-model:dev
```
