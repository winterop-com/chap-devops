# Chap behind the Modeling App

## A DHIS2, the apps and Chap, connected with one command

For people who use DHIS2 and the Modeling App

---

## What you see, and what runs behind it

<div class="columns">
<div>

**In DHIS2:**

- the Modeling App: evaluate a model, make a forecast
- the Climate App: climate data for your org units
- analytics: the data that the apps read

</div>
<div>

**Behind it:**

- **chap-core**: runs the evaluations and forecasts
- **models**: one container each (Simple Multistep, Auto-ARIMA, ...)
- **OCS**: climate data, if you want it

</div>
</div>

The Modeling App reaches chap-core through a **route** in DHIS2: DHIS2 sends
each request on to chap-core. chap-core never calls DHIS2.

---

## Three things must be correct

| Without it | What the Modeling App does |
| --- | --- |
| the `chap` route | sends you to "get started"; it cannot see Chap |
| the analytics tables | has no data to send, and says nothing about why |
| the apps | there is no Chap screen in DHIS2 |

Before chap-devops, you did each of these by hand: a route JSON, the App Hub, an
analytics run.

---

## A DHIS2 with Chap, from nothing

```sh
chap-devops init mychap --with dhis2 --models chapkit_simple_multistep_model
cd mychap
chap-devops up
chap-devops dhis2 connect
```

- `--with dhis2` adds a DHIS2, with the Laos climate demo (DHIS2 2.42).
- `chap-devops dhis2 connect` makes the route, installs the apps and generates
  analytics.

Open **http://localhost:8780** and log in as `admin` / `district`.

> **The first `chap-devops up` downloads about 25 GB** of images: chap-core, the
> model and DHIS2. Do it on a fast network.

---

## What `--with dhis2` adds

| Service | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `dhis2` | DHIS2 itself, from `dhis2/core`, on port 8780 |
| `dhis2-db` | its own PostgreSQL. Never published on the host. |
| `dhis2-dump` | a one-shot that prepares the demo dump, and exits |
| `dhis2-prep` | a one-shot on every start: `ANALYZE`, and it resets stale jobs |

- Its own database, apart from chap-core's: the two never share data.
- Three volumes: `dhis2_home` (apps and files), `dhis2_db`, and `dhis2_dump`
  (a download cache).

---

## The first start takes minutes

DHIS2 migrates its schema before it answers. The demo database is restored
before that.

| Shape | About |
| --- | --- |
| A native image, empty database | 40 seconds |
| Under emulation (an amd64 image on arm64) | 8 to 15 minutes |
| With the demo database | the above, plus the restore |

- `chap-devops status` shows each service. `chap-devops logs dhis2` shows the migration.
- `chap-devops dhis2` commands wait for DHIS2's API, up to 20 minutes by default.

---

## Memory

- DHIS2 needs about **4 to 5 GB** for the analytics populate phase.
- Below that, the JVM is killed part-way through analytics. The run never
  finishes, and the log shows no Java error.
- `chap-devops doctor` warns below 6 GB for docker, and fails below 4 GB.
- On Docker Desktop, raise the VM's memory: Settings, Resources.
- With OCS on 8 GB or less: set `CLIMATE_SERVICE_MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS=1` in
  `.env`, then run `chap-devops restart ocs`.

```ini
# DHIS2_JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-Xms2g -Xmx4g -XX:+UseG1GC
```

That line in `.env` sets the heap. Uncomment it and edit the whole set.

---

## Why `chap-devops up` does not connect

`chap-devops up` is a thin wrapper around `docker compose up`. Connecting is the
wrong work for it:

- it needs **DHIS2 credentials**, which are not chap-devops's to invent;
- it uses the **network**, the App Hub, and `chap-devops up` never does;
- DHIS2's API is **not ready when `up` returns**.

So `chap-devops up` and `chap-devops status` say it until a connect is recorded:

```text
chap-devops has not connected this DHIS2 to Chap; run `chap-devops dhis2 connect` once DHIS2 answers
```

---

## `chap-devops dhis2 connect`, step by step

1. **The route.** It creates the `chap` route, or repoints one that points
   elsewhere. Then it sends a request through it, to prove that chap-core
   answers.
2. **The apps.** It installs the Modeling App and the Climate App from the
   App Hub, at the newest version that this DHIS2 can run.
3. **Analytics.** It generates the analytics tables, and waits for the run.

Each step checks first, and does nothing when it is correct already. A second
run repoints nothing and reinstalls nothing, and says so.

---

## The `chap` route

- A **Route** is a row in DHIS2 with `code: "chap"`. DHIS2 serves it under
  `/api/routes/chap/run/` and passes each request to chap-core.
- The target is `http://chap:8000/**`: the compose service name, never
  `localhost`. The `/**` makes DHIS2 pass every path under it.
- The route needs the **`F_CHAP_MODELING_APP`** authority.
- With an API token, the route carries `Authorization: Bearer`. DHIS2 stores
  it and never lists it back.

---

## The route is repointed, not created

A seeded demo database **already has a `chap` route**, and it points at
someone else's Chap. So chap-devops compares, and rewrites:

```text
repointed the `chap` route at http://chap:8000/**
  it pointed at http://158.39.75.126/stable/**
  verified chap-core answered through it: healthy
```

It leaves the route alone only when the URL is this chap-core, the route is
not disabled, and it has the `F_CHAP_MODELING_APP` authority.

---

## When the route does not answer

The route is proved with `GET /api/routes/chap/run/health`, the same path as
the app uses:

```text
warning: the `chap` route is in place but nothing answered through it:
HTTP 502 Bad Gateway; run `chap-devops status` to see whether chap-core is up
```

DHIS2 42 and later allow only the targets in
`route.remote_servers_allowed`. chap-devops writes `http://*,https://*` into
`dhis2/dhis.conf`, so the route to `http://chap:8000` is allowed.

---

## Analytics

The Modeling App and the Climate App read DHIS2's `analytics_*` tables. The
tables exist only after an analytics run.

```sh
chap-devops dhis2 analytics            # start the run, and wait for it
chap-devops dhis2 analytics --no-wait  # start it, and return
```

- A run that goes already is watched, not queued behind: DHIS2 runs one at a
  time.
- **No `lastYears`.** On the Laos demo, `lastYears=8` wrote zero rows and
  reported success. chap-devops never sends it.

---

## Is analytics done? What `show` can say

On a seeded database, DHIS2's "last analytics" time comes from the dump, not
from this deployment. So `chap-devops dhis2 show` labels it:

| Row | What chap-devops checked |
| --- | --- |
| `never run` | DHIS2 records no run at all |
| `(a run finished on this deployment)` | a run finished since DHIS2 started |
| `(unconfirmed on a seeded database)` | the time can be the dump's |

When it is unconfirmed, `chap-devops dhis2 analytics` settles it. A second run is
safe.

---

## The apps, from the App Hub

| App | What it is for |
| --- | --- |
| Modeling App | the Chap user interface in DHIS2 |
| DHIS2 Climate App | imports climate data through Google Earth Engine: the Modeling App's covariates |

- DHIS2 downloads the app itself, from the App Hub. chap-devops only asks.
- chap-devops selects the newest version that this DHIS2 can run.
- An app at that version is left alone. An app at another version is moved.

---

## The demo database: the seed

| `--dhis2-seed` | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| `default` | the demo dump for the pinned line: the Laos climate demo on 2.42 |
| `none` | an empty database, migrated from nothing |
| a URL | that dump, downloaded |
| a path | that file, in the deployment directory |

The seed applies **once**, when the database is created. A later `chap-devops up`
does not restore it again.

---

## Which DHIS2 version

```sh
chap-devops init mychap --with dhis2 --dhis2-tag 2.41
chap-devops init mychap --with dhis2 --dhis2-tag 2.43 --dhis2-seed none
chap-devops init mychap --with dhis2 --dhis2-image dhis2/core-dev --dhis2-tag master
chap-devops components enable dhis2 --tag 2.41       # later
```

- The tag is a minor line (`2.42`), so a patch release comes with a pull.
- `dhis2/core-dev` with `master` is the next, unreleased DHIS2. It has no demo
  database, so it starts empty.

---

## Forward only: back up first

DHIS2 migrates its schema **forward only**:

- a **newer** image migrates the database when it starts, and you cannot undo
  it;
- an **older** image on a migrated database answers its health check, but
  every API request gives 404.

```sh
chap-devops backup create
chap-devops components enable dhis2 --tag 2.43
chap-devops up
```

chap-devops warns when a change moves the tag while `dhis2_db` exists.

---

## `dhis2/dhis.conf`

- DHIS2 does **not start without it**. chap-devops writes it once, and never
  rewrites it. It is yours.
- Its values come from the environment: the database host, name, user and
  password, and `DHIS2_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD`.
- The encryption password is 32 random characters in `.env`, written once.
  Changing it later makes the stored credentials unreadable.

After an edit:

```sh
chap-devops restart dhis2
```

`chap-devops restart` sees that the file is newer than the container, and recreates
it.

---

## The DHIS2 login that chap-devops uses

The first source with a value wins:

| Order | Source |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `DHIS2_API_TOKEN` in `.env`: a personal access token |
| 2 | `DHIS2_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env`, for `DHIS2_ADMIN_USERNAME` |
| 3 | `CHAP_DEVOPS_DHIS2_TOKEN` in the environment |
| 4 | `CHAP_DEVOPS_DHIS2_PASSWORD` in the environment |
| 5 | `seed_password:` in `.chap-devops/components.yaml`, only on a DHIS2 that chap-devops deployed |
| 6 | `admin` / `district`, only on a DHIS2 that chap-devops deployed |

There is **no `--password` flag**: a password on a command line goes into the
shell history.

---

## A DHIS2 that runs elsewhere

```sh
chap-devops init chap-server --models chapkit_simple_multistep_model --api-token
cd chap-server && chap-devops up
chap-devops dhis2 use https://dhis2.example.org --chap-url https://chap.example.org
chap-devops dhis2 connect
```

- `use` records both URLs in `.chap-devops/components.yaml`.
- Then it asks DHIS2 two things: does `/api/ping` answer, and does it accept
  the login.
- An external DHIS2 has **no default login**. A personal access token is the
  natural choice.

---

## What changes with an external DHIS2

- **`connect` sets the route, and nothing else.** Apps and analytics change a
  server that chap-devops does not run, so they stay with its admin. `connect` ends
  with a `skipped:` line for each.
- **Nothing asks docker**: there is no container.
- **The allowlist is that server's**: `route.remote_servers_allowed` in its
  own `dhis.conf`.
- It is one DHIS2 or the other: `use` refuses while the `dhis2` component is
  on.

---

## `chap-devops dhis2 show` and `connected_at`

- `chap-devops dhis2 show` asks and reports: where the route points and whether
  chap-core answers through it, analytics, the two apps, and each missing
  piece. It changes nothing.
- After a connect that proved the route, chap-devops records `connected_at` in
  `.chap-devops/components.yaml`.
- `connected_at` only stops the hint in `up` and `status`. It is **not**
  proof that the route is correct today. `chap-devops dhis2 show` is what asks
  DHIS2.

---

## Climate data from OCS

```sh
chap-devops components enable ocs
chap-devops up
chap-devops open ocs
```

- Open Climate Service serves climate data over STAC and openEO, on port 8790.
- WorldPop and CHIRPS3 work with no credentials. ERA5-Land needs one in
  `.env`.
- `ocs/climate-service.yaml` is the instance's configuration. Edit it: it
  ships with example values.

---

## OCS: schedules

OCS can sync a dataset again on a schedule. The file only turns the
scheduler on:

```yaml
scheduler:
  enabled: true
```

- Make the schedules in the Schedule tab of a dataset in the OCS web UI.
- Or make them with `POST /schedules/sync`. `chap-devops backup` keeps them.
- An old `dataset_sync:` list stops OCS with
  `scheduler.dataset_sync is no longer supported`. Remove the list, run
  `chap-devops restart ocs`, and make the schedules again.

---

## More models

```sh
chap-devops models list                       # the marketplace
chap-devops models enable auto_arima_chapkit  # one more model
chap-devops up
```

- A new model registers with chap-core, and the Modeling App lists it.
- `chap-devops status` shows the registration of each model.
- `chap-devops models test --all --backtest` runs a backtest of each model through
  chap-core, the way the Modeling App does.

---

## What the Modeling App lists

The model list shows **configured models**, not model services:

```text
<model name> [<variant name>]
```

- A configured model is a model with a set of option values and covariates.
- One model service can give several entries: Simple Multistep gives two.
- `chap-devops models configs` shows the same list in the terminal, with the
  option values and covariates of each entry.

---

## Where the entries come from

chap-core 2.4 and later makes no configured model when a model registers.
chap-devops makes them, one for each configuration of the marketplace entry:

```sh
chap-devops models configs sync
```

```text
chapkit_simple_multistep_model: created configured model monthly_climate
chapkit_simple_multistep_model: created configured model monthly_selfhistory
```

`chap-devops up --wait` and `chap-devops dhis2 connect` do the same step. A model without
entries shows in `chap-devops status` as `registered, not configured`.

---

## A variant of your own

```sh
chap-devops models configs add chapkit_simple_multistep_model \
  --name short_lags --set n_target_lags=3 --set rf_max_depth=5 \
  --covariates rainfall
```

```text
created configured model short_lags of chapkit_simple_multistep_model
```

- `--name` is the variant name: the Modeling App shows it in brackets.
- chap-devops checks each key and each value against the options of the model.
- With no options at a terminal, `add` opens a form: one field for each
  option, with its default.
- `chap-devops models test ID --backtest --config short_lags` runs a backtest
  of it.

---

## Change, archive, export

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `chap-devops models configs update ID NAME` | gives the variant new values |
| `chap-devops models configs archive ID NAME` | archives the variant |
| `chap-devops models configs export ID` | writes the variants in the marketplace format |

- chap-core never deletes a configured model. It **archives** it, and keeps
  it for the backtests and predictions that use it.
- An update makes a new configured model and archives the old one.
- The Modeling App shows an archived configured model as Archived.

---

## A 401 from the Modeling App

```text
{"detail": "Missing or invalid API token"}
```

The route sends a token that chap-core does not accept, or sends none.

```sh
chap-devops dhis2 connect     # writes this deployment's token into the route
```

Two causes:

- `chap-devops auth rotate` ran, and the route still has the old token;
- `chap-devops auth enable` ran, and `chap-devops up` did not.

---

## Models that do not register after `auth enable`

```text
chapkit-simple-multistep-model  running, not registered  via chap-core  -
```

A protected chap-core refuses a registration without the key. The containers
read `.env` only when compose creates them:

```sh
chap-devops up
chap-devops status
```

`chap-devops auth enable` writes `SERVICEKIT_REGISTRATION_KEY` beside the token,
and gives it to every model.

---

## When something does not work

```sh
chap-devops doctor        # docker, ports, memory, pins, and whether Chap is up
chap-devops status        # chap-core, the models, DHIS2
chap-devops dhis2 show    # the route, the apps, analytics
```

Each line that is wrong names the fix. For example:

```text
warn  memory   5.0 GB available to docker
      keep at least 6.0 GB for docker: DHIS2 alone wants 4.0 GB for the
      analytics populate phase, ...
```

---

## Start now

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/winterop-com/chap-devops/main/install.sh | sh
chap-devops init mychap --with dhis2 --models chapkit_simple_multistep_model
cd mychap && chap-devops up && chap-devops dhis2 connect
```
